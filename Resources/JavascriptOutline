Outline for Javascript Class

i. Setup the environment
	a. Class will use Plnkr.co to compile
	b. Show Live changes, html & js file, developer tools for fast feedback
	c. JS is case sensitive, show hello world on developer tools output and show how it catches errors

ii. Beginnings
	a. Storing information on variables
		- "let" to assign a variable, and printing the variable, defining multiple variables with one let
		- reassigning variables
	b. Variable Errors
		- product not defined, undefined, unexpected token class
	c. String and Numeric variables
		- Examples of Strings: 'hello', "hello", "hello's"
		- Examples of Numbers: 5, 3.00, 0.42
		- Adding numbers and why they need to be numbers and not strings
			- ex: 5+3=8, 5+"3"=53 since it js doesn't know string vs number
		- using "+" operator on strings vs numbers (concat)
		- Take user prompt and print, firstname & lastname
	d. Simple Operators
		- +, -, *, /, %, ()
	e. Comments
		- //, /* */, in line comments
	f. Starting blackjack application
		- Defining our variables and printing the hello to blackjack

iii. Types and Arrays
	a. String and Number types
		- "TypeOf" Function
		- Take user prompt and print, num1 + num2
			- function: parseInt
	b. Boolean types
		- true, false, typeof
	c. undefined and null
		- uninitialized=undefined, intentionally blank out a variable = null
	d. Arrays
		- values are called elements
		- [], subscripting to get array values,	arrays can have any datatype,
		- array features, .length, .push, .pop, .shift, .splice
		- array methods on Google
	e. Adding Arrays to blackjack
		- create array of deck, and playercards

iv.	Program Flow
	a. conditions
		- if
			- introduce ===, >, >=, !==, etc on the if
		- else
			- else if
		- switch-case
		- looping with for
			- introduce ++ as well
		- looping with while
		- Introduce Nested loops
		- adding loops to blackjack
			- Use nested loops to loop through array of suits and values to create a deck of 52
