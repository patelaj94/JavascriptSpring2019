Class 5 exercises

1. Let's make a student object:
Make an object called student that has two properties: name, and a list of grades. Make an example student with two grades.

2. Finish the below function that takes in a student object, and gives back their average, based on the list of grades.
	// function gradeMe(student) {
	//    let sumOfGrades = 0
	//    for (i = 0; i < student.grades.length; i++) { 
  	//		sumOfGrades += student.grades[i];
	//		}
	//	  return 0
	// }
