// Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the greater of the two

// Create an object BasketballPlayer with 5 variables in the object:
	// name, position(ex: point guard), pointsPerGame(ex:28.5), assistsPerGame(ex:7.6),
	// reboundsPerGame(ex:5.5)
	// 1. Print this object using console log
	// 2. Create two more basketball players and convert the three objects to an array
	// of basketball players
	// 3. print each player's name and points per game using console.log

// Make an array of 5 objects with (State, Capital, and population)
	// Create a function that will take that array of objects and
	// Loop through each object and print each State's capital which has a
	// population greater than 3 million. 
	// You can make up the populations or Google and keep them accurate. Up to you.
